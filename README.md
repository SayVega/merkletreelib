# Merkle Tree (Rust)

This project implements a **Merkle Tree** as a reusable **library crate in Rust**.

## Scope

The library provides the following guarantees:

- Build a Merkle Tree from an array of elements.
- Generate a Merkle proof for a given element.
- Verify that a hash is contained in the tree using a proof.
- Support dynamic trees (elements can be added after initial construction).

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md)
